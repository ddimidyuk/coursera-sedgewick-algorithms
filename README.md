# Coursera: Algorithms
My programming assignments to the Algorithms, [Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) by Kevin Wayne, Robert Sedgewick of the Princeton University.
## Basic Information
This course covers the most basic and essential algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on complexity and performance of the Java implementations. 

Part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. The programming language used is Java.

It's a free course provided by Coursera. You can find the course here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1

## Structure of the Repo

Each of the folder comprises of a code for that particular week of the course. The PDF file explains the coding problem. The Test Examples consists of files provided
by the course and the code folder consists of the actual code.

It should only be used as reference and should not be submitted in order to pass the course. Thank you!
